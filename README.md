## Description

DeleteWalls is an application that takes in a rvt file and outputs another rvt file with all of the walls removed. The files in this repository are to be used as exercise files for a [tutorial](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/design-automation/v3/tutorials/revit-edit/step1-convert-addin/) to convert a typical Revit add-in to a Design Automation ready Revit add-in.

This repository contains two folders. Each of them contains a C# project. The folders are:

- [Desktop_Version](Desktop_Version) - 
  Contains a C# project of the DeleteWalls sample, which produces an add-in that runs on the desktop version of Revit.

- [Design-Automation_Version](Design-Automation_Version) - 
  Contains a C# project of the DeleteWalls sample, which produces an add-in that runs on  Design Automation.

Refer to the readme in each folder for details on each project.
